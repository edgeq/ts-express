# GEN AI EXPLORATIONS

## About

This repo is an exploration of what's possible with Typescript, Express, and other packages, librarires, and models that might be interesting for Generative AI & JavaScript Development. It's more of a sketch pad to see what's out there.

## Project 1
Uses the OpenAI ChatCompletion (`gpt-4o-mini`) and Image Generation (`dall-e-2`) models to take user input, re-write the prompt, and generate an image. It also makes use of `HTMx` for minimalist server requests and `Twig` templating language for HTML-friendly markup.


> More Projects to Follow... until then, check out this weird image I was able to generate.

## Project 2
Uses the Replicate API to run various models (`stability-ai/sdxl` and `videocrafter`) for Text-to-Image generation and Text-to-Video generation.
